AMES IT SQL Server Industry Project

My name is Rahul Lal and I’m currently studying the Diploma in Distributed Software Development at AMES IT. Previously I completed the Diploma in Software Development at Computer Power Plus

My first industry project at AMES IT, is a relational database management system (RDBMS)  for McDanny, a fictitious fast food restaurant. I’d create the database using Transact-Structured Query Language (TSQL),  a programming language use to manage the data inside the DBMS, this is also an extension of Structured Query Language (SQL) from Microsoft. The integrated development environment (The software of the data creation) used was SQL Server Management Studio 2014, also used Visual Studio Data Tools to create multiple SSIS Packages.
